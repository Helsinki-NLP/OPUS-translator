# HelTran

HelTran is an online translation demonstrator. HelTran is an [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application that serves translation models online. The translation models are run on [Marian NMT](https://marian-nmt.github.io/).

## How to deploy HelTran

The are two ways to deploy the HelTran demonstrator:

1. Launch an instance from a snapshot on cPouta.
2. Clone the project from GitHub.

### Deployment method 1: cPouta

The following only works if you have access to project 2000661.

#### Launch an instance

Launch instance from "translation_snapshot2" snapshot.

In order to have enough memory (4G) to run two translation models reliably, use "standard.medium" flavor.

On "Access & Security" tab, tick all checkboxes (Web, default, SSH) under "Security Groups".

#### Configure apache

Connect to you instance and go to Apache configuration file at `/etc/apache2/sites-available/translate.conf`

Change `ServerName` to your server name or ip-address.

If you want to use secure connection, you need to set up an SSL certificate. Secure connection is required if you want keep usernames and password safe, when users are registering or logging in. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) offers free SSL certificates.
If you have an SSL certificate, replace `SSLCertificateFile` and `SSLCertigicateKeyFile`, with your files.

If you are not worried about usernames and passwords, you can set up the server without a secure connection. In this case, replace the contents of the configuration file with:

```
## /etc/apache2/sites-available/translate.conf

NameVirtualHost *:80
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName <your_server_name_or_ip-address>

  WSGIDaemonProcess translate
  WSGIScriptalias / /home/cloud-user/translation-demo/translate.wsgi

<Directory /home/cloud-user/translation-demo/>
  WSGIProcessGroup translate
  WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
  WSGIScriptReloading On

  Require all granted
</Directory>

  ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
  CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
    
```

Restart apache server with:

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

The application is now online at your ip-address, and it runs the translation models danosv-fi and fi-danosv.

#### Configure translation models

To stop running the current translation models, find the process ids for the models with:

```
ps -ef | grep model_server
```

Then kill each of the processes with:

```
kill <process-id>
```

To work with new translation models, first:

```
cd ~/translation-demo/model-server
```

To run a new translation model in the background and redirect errors to <log-file>, run:

```
python3 model_server.py <model_config_file> <port> <preprocess_script> <postprocess_script> <sentence_splitter_script> > <log_file> 2>&1 &
```

For example danosv-fi model is run with:

```
python3 model_server.py danosv-fi-config.yml 5003 preprocess_danosv.sh postprocess.sh split.sh > danosv-fi.log 2>&1 &
```

**There are currently a couple of hardcoded things that you need to change, if you use different models than the ones that are currently on the virtual machine:**

In `~/translation-demo/templates/index.html` under the select tag on line 7, change the option values and names to correspond with your translation directions.

In `~/translation-demo/translate.py` on line 35 onwards, there are if clauses that tie the translation directions from `index.html` to translation model server ports.Add a clause, where your option value from `index.html` is tied to the port where set serve your translation model with `model_server.py`:

```
elif direction == <value_from_index.html>:
    sock.connect(("localhost", <port_from_model_server_command>)
```

After making changes to `translate.py`, restart the server with:

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Your model is now online at you ip-address

### Deployment method 2: Clone project from GitHub

Coming soon...
