Europarl v6 Preprocessing Tools
===============================
written by Philipp Koehn and Josh Schroeder


Sentence Splitter
=================
Usage ./split-sentences.perl -l [en|de|...] < textfile > splitfile

Uses punctuation and Capitalization clues to split paragraphs of 
sentences into files with one sentence per line. For example:

This is a paragraph. It contains several sentences. "But why," you ask?

goes to:

This is a paragraph.
It contains several sentences.
"But why," you ask?

See more information in the Nonbreaking Prefixes section.


Nonbreaking Prefixes Directory
==============================

Nonbreaking prefixes are loosely defined as any word ending in a
period that does NOT indicate an end of sentence marker. A basic
example is Mr. and Ms. in English.

The sentence splitter and tokenizer included with this release
both use the nonbreaking prefix files included in this directory.

To add a file for other languages, follow the naming convention
nonbreaking_prefix.?? and use the two-letter language code you
intend to use when calling split-sentences.perl and tokenizer.perl.

Both split-sentences and tokenizer will first look for a file for the
language they are processing, and fall back to English if a file
for that language is not found. If the nonbreaking_prefixes directory does
not exist at the same location as the split-sentences.perl and tokenizer.perl
files, they will not run.

For the splitter, normally a period followed by an uppercase word
results in a sentence split. If the word preceeding the period
is a nonbreaking prefix, this line break is not inserted.

For the tokenizer, a nonbreaking prefix is not separated from its 
period with a space.

A special case of prefixes, NUMERIC_ONLY, is included for special
cases where the prefix should be handled ONLY when before numbers.
For example, "Article No. 24 states this." the No. is a nonbreaking
prefix. However, in "No. It is not true." No functions as a word.

See the example prefix files included here for more examples.
